# BladesofGreen
BladesofGreen.com is a prospective website that will be designed in order to sell astroturf to clients online. The client, Brad Hoover, is a small business owner based out of Orange County. As the owner of a landscape company that focuses on bringing xeriscapes to the residents of Orange County. As Bradâ€™s business has grown, he sees an opening for a website that can be used as an interface for his clients to purchase Astroturfing by the square ft.  He wants the finished project to be a simple-to-use website that the average 50 year old can easily navigate.
The e-commerce platform shopify provided us with a great place to begin constructing the website, the pre-built cart and checkout sequence save time while the use of shopify's theme kit makes customization possible.
The first thing we had to do was download the theme kit editor using Homebrew.
After downloading the theme kit editor we set all of the permissions for the new app so we can make changes to the storefront.  The theme kit editor automatically updates the site when you use the command "theme watch" in terminal.
From there making changes to content on the page can be as simple as changing data in the data_settings.json file.
