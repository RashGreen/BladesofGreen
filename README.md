BladesofGreen.com is a prospective website that will be designed in order to sell astroturf to clients online. The client, Brad Hoover, is a small business owner based out of Orange County. As the owner of a landscape company that focuses on bringing xeriscapes to the residents of Orange County. As Bradâ€™s business has grown, he sees an opening for a website that can be used as an interface for his clients to purchase Astroturfing by the square ft.  He wants the finished project to be a simple-to-use website that the average 50 year old can easily navigate.
